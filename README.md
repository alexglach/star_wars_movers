# Star Wars Movers

The application uses the [Star Wars API](swapi.co/documentation) to allow users to reserve a vehicle for their inter-galactic move. Users can choose their origin and destination, and depending on whether they need hyperdrive or not, a starship or a smaller vehicle. Once their reservation is booked, users can also choose local movers to help their move in or out. 

This project was built during a one-day solo hackathon at [Viking Code School](www.vikingcodeschool.com). It was focused purely on back-end functionality, and was a chance to work on:
  - Creating API calls
  - JSON parsing
  - Rails CRUD
  - Rails Active Record Associations
  - Nested Forms

The live app is [available here](https://frozen-mountain-23545.herokuapp.com/)
